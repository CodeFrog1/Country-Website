            The Alethi people are a class of people with special characteristics and because of their heritage
            they have certain privlages and responsibilities. You are an Alethi if you are tall, have "light eyes"
            such as blue, green, or olive, tan skin, and wealth. Their expected manorisms are to show martial prowess,
            to not show affection in public, to not disturb people while eating and to worship vorinism. Women usually
            have to be more manored and professional since they have many responsibilities as scribes, soul casters, etc.
            They are supposed to cover their left hand since it is considered an "inapropriate" hand.
