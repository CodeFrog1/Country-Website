            Soul casters use 10 fabrials or gemstones that when used by soulcasters<br>
            can transmute matter. When they use fabrials their minds go into shadesmar<br>
            where they then have to use a corresponding fabrial to convice matter like<br>
            rocks or wind to change into something else like grain or wood. Their uses<br>
            across many nations are many, they are one of the primary sources of production<br>
            such as brick, straw, and wood for buildings. They are used to produce weapons<br>
            such as swords, spears and sheilds during wartime or when supply is low. And most<br>
            importantly they can turn matter into food supplying populations for a long time<br>
            and keeping a war campaign going on just transmuted grain alone. Oh and they can<br>
            only make bread and soulcasters are pridominately women.
