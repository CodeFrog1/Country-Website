            Alethkar was founded as Alethela in the silver kingdoms Epoch when the Sunmaker's 10 children split the silver kingdom into ten kingdoms with 10 
            ruling high princes. Alethkar is one of those 10 countries.

        <p class="homepage">
            Kholinar is the capital of Alethkar and is the most populated city in Alethkar. Although there is no direct number for the population of Alethkar 
            we can infer from the book that the Alethi people and the Alethkar government are millitarily oriented and most of their resources go to supporting
            war efforts and a lot of solderies and even civilians die in such frequent conflicts and conquests. Although they are a large power on the planet of
            roshar they probably only acount for about 2-3/10 of the world's population.

            The Alethi people speak Alethi common (although there might be some accents from different regions) but their writing is unique, the book doesn't 
            identify how they speak but it does identify how they write. In Alethkar the women are the ones who write, send letters, write books, etc 
            (it is culturally seen as a feminine art). Usually if a man wants something writen down then they have to go through a women of whom would 
            usually be your wife, relative, or scholar. Ardents are the exception for they are preists of the vorin religion and have to be litterate 
            to document religious ceremonies, the will of the almighty, and the religion's history. Although they do not write for you or anyone except 
            the almighty. "Since Alethi has no W or X, the respective English transliterations are U and KS. The English letter C is written as either S 
            or K depending on its pronunciation. H may not quite sound like an H, but it's being used to represent H in English transliteration. The letter 
            J is pronounced exactly like Y in modern Alethi. There may have been a sound change involved there. It's being used here as a J sound."
            Men can read glyphs of which are just symbols that represent important things, it is not a full language just like using arrows, hammers
            or burger icons is not a language.
